        <!-- The player will have to guess the answer, just like in Word Guess. This time, though, the player will guess with numbers instead of letters. 
        Here's how the app works:
        
        
        
        There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

        //Create 4 buttons// DONE!

        The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

        //Display random number between 19 - 120 DONE!
        
        When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 
        
        //Create display for total score// DONE!
        //create a var to track total score//DONE!
        //click events for buttons//DONT WORK?????
        //create function to read value of each crystal and add to total score//DONT WORK???

        
        Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
        When they do click one, update the player's score counter.
        
        
        The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

        //create if state total score = random number player wins

        The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

        //else if total score > random number player loses
        
        The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

        //create var to track wins/losses//DONE!
        //create display for wins/losses//DONE!
        
        //inside if/else reset total score back to 0 
        //generate new random number
        //generate new values for crystals
        
        When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
        
        
        The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
        
        
        
        Option 1 Game design notes
        
        
        The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120.
        Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12. -->
